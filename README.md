## üìä Key Insights from the Dashboard  

### 1. **Global Overview**
- The platform generated **billions of views globally**, with likes and comments showing a healthy engagement-to-view ratio.  
- The **average trending duration** revealed that only a few videos sustain long-term popularity, while the majority trend for shorter periods.
